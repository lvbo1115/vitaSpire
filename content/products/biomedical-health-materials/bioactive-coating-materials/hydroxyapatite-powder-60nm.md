HAP01-60

## Product Name

Hydroxyapatite (HAp) Powder, 60nm

## Background

Hydroxyapatite is the main inorganic component of human bones and teeth, possessing excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. In the field of biomaterials, it is primarily used in orthopedic and dental applications for bone repair and replacement, such as bone defect filling, alveolar ridge augmentation, and implant coatings. It can effectively guide new bone formation and form a stable bond with the host bone.
